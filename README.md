# Ping Graphing Utility
A ping visualisation utility app developed by mz_d. .

Choose where you want to save your ping graph ("Untitled.csv by default"),  
type in the address you want to ping and launch!  
---
This program provides a visual graph updated in real-time, a way to save the data to a .CSV file and a live feed of the current ping in the application's window title, so you can know your latency by a simple glance at your taskbar.

> Further features will be coming at an undisclosed date.
